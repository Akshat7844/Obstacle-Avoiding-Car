# ObstacleAvoidingCar
Project Problem Statement

IOT Based Obstacle Detecting Arduino Car

• We decided why not to make a car which detects the obstacle on its own.

• It would be very helpful if we are able to create a prototype as many people die in accidents each year due to the same.

• As a machine the car would detect itself the obstacle with the help of sensors and help in reducing traffic and accidents.

Key features/Benefits

• It detects on its own the obstacle with the help of sensors, stops and changes its path.

• We can control it by coding it and using the app through phone or controlling it with the laptop/pc.

• It is a cost-effective solution to stop accidents, lessen the traffic also aid in the parking.
